Gold Wallet App

A simple Gold Wallet app built with React Native (Expo)

This app allows users to log in with their email and manage their gold and cash balance
Each user has their own wallet, and data is stored persistently using AsyncStorage


âœ¨ Features

ðŸ”‘ Login (dummy authentication using email)

ðŸ“Š Dashboard (shows gold & cash balance)

ðŸ›’ Buy Gold (fixed gold price â‚¹10,000/g, updates balance)

ðŸ”„ Transfer Gold (send gold to another userâ€™s wallet, with validation checks)

ðŸ“œ Transaction History (records buys & transfers)

ðŸ’¾ Persistent Storage via AsyncStorage (per user, based on email)

ðŸ‘¤ User-specific wallets (balances and history are stored individually)



ðŸ“Œ Notes

Balances & history are not cleared on logout â€“ they persist for each email.

Each user has an independent wallet.
